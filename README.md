# A View From Above: Predicting car park occupancy rates from satellite images with a deep learning model

This repository gathers parts of a my work towards my MSc Research Project and Dissertation. It includes:
 - The satellite images I have collected from Google Earth
 - The JavaScript code used to access the satellite imagery on Google Earth Engine
 - The notebook which applies a deep learning algorithm, YOLOv4, for vehicle detection, and produces the results for my dissertation. It constitutes the main component of the methodological contribution I propose as part of this research project.
